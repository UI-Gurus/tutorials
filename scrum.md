## What is it?

Scrum is an Agile framework for completing complex projects. It originally was formalized for software development projects, but it works well for any complex, innovate scope of work. Scrum is lightweight, simple to understand and difficult to master

## How it works

There are three roles on a Scrum methodology: Product owner, Scrum master and the team. The product owner creates a prioritized wish list called a product backlog. During the sprint planning, the team pulls a small chunk from the top of that wish list, a sprint backlog, and decides how to implement those pieces. The team has a certain amount of time -a sprint (usually two to four weeks)- to complete its work, but it meets each day to assess its progress (daily scrum). Along the way, the ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on its goal. At the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially shippable: ready to hand to a customer, put on a store shelf or show to a stakeholder. The sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective. As the next sprint begins, the team chooses another chunk of the product backlog and begins working again.

The cycle repeats until enough items in the product backlog have been completed, the budget is depleted or a deadline arrives. Which of these milestones marks the end of the work is entirely specific to the project. No matter which impetus stops work. Scrum ensures that the most valuable work has been completed when the project ends.

## Scrum events

#### The sprint

The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during a potentially releasable product increment is created. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint. During the Sprint no changes are made that would endanger the sprint goal, quality goals do not decrease and scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

Each sprint may be considered a project with no more that a one-month horizon. Like projects, sprints are used to accomplish something. Each sprint has a definition of what is to be built, a design and flexible plan that will guide building it, the work, and the resultant product.

#### Sprint planning

This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team. Sprint planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month sprint. For shorter sprints, the event is usually shorter. The ScrumMaster ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose. Sprint planning answers the following: What can be delivered in the increment resulting from the upcoming sprint and how will the work needed to deliver the increment be achieved.

#### Daily Scrum

The daily scrum is a 15 minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. This is done by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting the work that could be done before the next one. The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity. During the meeting, the development team members explain:

* What did I do yesterday that helped the development team meet the sprint goal.
* What will I do today to help the development team meet the sprint goal.
* Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the development team from meeting the sprint goal

#### Sprint review

A sprint review is held at the end of the sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the sprint review, the Scrum team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value.

#### Sprint retrospective

The sprint retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next spring. It occurs after the sprint review and prior to the next sprint planning.
