## What is it?

What is Agile? We can define it as the ability to create and respond to change in order of an uncertain and turbulent environment.

Accordingly to the Agile Alliance we have the following definition of what is Agile Software Development:

Agile Software Development is an umbrella term for a set of methods and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Agile Manifesto.

## The Agile Manifesto

It describes a set of values and principles for software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams.

There are some core values in the Manifesto that help to understand the operation of an Agile methodology:

* #### **individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

  This core value tell us that is more important allow people to contribute with our software development project. The result of do this can be powerful. The emphasis on individuals and teams puts the focus on people and their energy, innovation and ability to solve problems. If we value individuals and interactions we can obtain great benefits:

  * Communication is clear and effective
  * Communication is quick and efficient
  * Teamwork becomes strong as people work together
  * Development teams have more chances to innovate

* #### **Working software** over comprehensive documentation

  This second core value tell us that a software development team must focus on producing working products. This is the only way to measure whether we are truly done with a product requirement. Agile project teams produce fewer, more streamlined documents that take less time to maintain and provide better visibility into potential issues. In conclusion, project teams with this approach spend more time on development and less time on documentation, resulting in a more efficient delivery of a working product.

* #### **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

  Agile methodologies make the customer part of the project on an ongoing basis. On an agile project, customer review is built into the process and the customer gets to see the product at the end of every sprint. You can create the highest priority features first, which gives you the opportunity to ensure maximum value early on, when little of the customer's money has been invested.

* #### **Responding to change** over following a plan

  Change is a valuable tool for creating great products. Using Agile management principles, project teams that can respond quickly to customers, product users and the market in general, are able to develop relevant, helpful products that people want to use. The Agile approaches to planning, working and prioritization allow project teams to respond quickly to change. As new events unfold, the project team incorporates those realities into the ongoing work. Any new item becomes an opportunity to provide additional value instead of an obstacle to avoid, giving development teams a greater opportunity for success.

## Principles behind the Agile Manifesto

The Manifesto follows these principles:

* #### Satisfy the customer

  You, as a member of a development team, should not be distracted and keep your focus on the most important thing, the acceptance of every requirement of the software. The first results of the wanted software have to be given to the users as soon as possible, so that they can give their feedback and generate more insights about what they really need and want. It is not enough to show the first result of the software but it is necessary to show intermediate results on a short regular basis

* #### Embrace change

  An Agile team should not take any requirement granted as reality. People, markets, demands, all things in general are in a constant flow and change. We have to accept this in every aspect of our work and there is no valid time to fix a set of requirements even if the project's end is a few weeks in the future. Things may change at any time.

* #### Frequent delivery

  The results of our efforts must not be theoretical concepts or prototypes, but a functional software product the user is able to work with effectively and these results should be delivered in a short time, so the customer is able to react and decide quickly.

* #### Cross-functional collaboration

  All people involved in the project must work together: users, customers, testers, technical writers, interface designers, business analysts and whatever role that is necessary to give input and create a working software product. This collaboration and communication must be a continuous basis. The product Owner has to be present and available to the team during the whole iterations, not just at the planning and review meeting.

* #### Support and trust

  An Agile team needs motivated people who love their job and are passionate about what they are doing. Do not demand results from the team but give them what they demand for their private and professional life. Also, the team needs a proper workspace and the best equipment available to do its work in a professional manner. It is necessary to help the team instantly as they get stuck. Clear their path and remove any obstacles. If you have motivated individuals on the team, you also have to trust them. They are the people knowing exactly how to do their job. Do not let anyone else decide and plan how the team should work and who is going to do what and when.

* #### Face to face conversation

  Do not open inefficient communication channels like writing things down on paper, emails, and bug-tracking systems. Rather talk to the receiver of your message directly via phone, video, or in the best case in front of a white board from person to person. Also, some tools like an information radiator or a build light indicator are often used to communicate the team about project progress.

* #### Working software

  Yes, again it does not matter how many modules, interfaces and documents we have in progress, the only thing that counts is completed, fully functional pieces of the wanted product. No one is interested in the number of work hours, lines of code, or any other technical metric. Only done and releasable features are important.

* #### Sustainable pace

  The people involved in the product creation chain must neither suffer from excessive labor nor sit around idling and waiting. An important practice especially for the team is collective ownership of both code and responsibility. Especially at the end of a project all people should keep calm and just flow with that constant pace.

* #### Technical excellence

  Keep your concentration high, stay focused on the things you are working on. This also implies to take a break when you are not able to do so. Do not force yourself to go on if you are distracted and powerless. Gather the right staff with the right skills to create the product. Cultivate life-long learning to acquire knowledge and improve your skills. Do not create a product which looks nice outside but is a piece of crap inside. Follow a professional honor and build your software product in a way you could be proud of in every detail.

* #### Keep it simple

  Always think about unnecessary tasks in your todo list. Think about requirements no one needs fulfilled to do their job. The essence is what really create value. All other things are nice-to-haves, gold plating, and pure technical bits and pieces. We need to focus on the essence to reach the goals we are committed to.

* #### Self-organizing

  We talk about discovering product ideas, as well as finding the challenges they offer and exploring appropriate solutions. These artifacts must not be approached each on its own, but as a whole system belonging together and building the resulting product. The artifacts can not be planned up-front but will be discovered and created in an evolutionary way. Do not think too long about the right way to do something. Just do it in an iterative-incremental way and improve that way by reflecting afterwards.

* #### Inspect and adapt

  It is not enough to take a look at the project after it is finished. We are not able to change our product development habits afterwards. We have to take a look at our current behavior in an iterative way. Only the team is able to inspect its own habits and to decide what and how to change. The worst reflection is a reflection without any insights and action items. There have to be actionable results for the team so that it is possible to take charge of these actions.

## Adaptive vs Predictive

Agile software methodologies use an adaptive planning process. An adaptive method has the following characteristics:

* Focuses on adapting quickly to changing realities
* When the needs of a project change, an adaptive team changes as well
* An adaptive team has difficulty describing exactly what will happen in the future
* An adaptive team cannot report exactly what tasks they will do next week, but only which features they plan for next months
* Rolling wave approach: Identifies milestones but leaves flexibility in the path to reach them, and also allows for milestones themselves to change

Meanwhile, other methodologies, like waterfall, tends to use a predictive planning method. Let's see some of its characteristics:

* Focuses on analyzing and planning the future in detail and cater for known risks
* Teams with this working method could report exactly what features and tasks are planned for the entire length of the project.
* Rely on effective early phase analysis and if this goes very wrong, the project may have difficulty changing direction.

## Iterative vs Waterfall

AS we see, Agile methodologies use an adaptive planning method and it uses an iterative approach as well. Let's take a look of What involves each of the iterations or sprints

* A cross-functional team working in all functions: planning, analysis, design, coding, unit testing and acceptance testing
* At the end of the iteration a working product is demonstrated to stakeholders
* An iteration might not add enough functionality to warrant a market release, but the goal is to have an available release with minimal bugs at the end of each iteration

And what about other methodologies like waterfall. Here are some characteristics to compare with an iterative methodology

* In this model, phases are processed and completed one at a time
* Works well for small projects where requirements are very well understood
* Once an application is in the testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change something that was not well-thought out in the concept stage
* No working software is produced until late during the life cycle
* Not suitable for the projects where requirements are at a moderate to high risk of changing
